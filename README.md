## Getting Started using Symfony Docker

MSP Challenge's Docker configuration is based on [Symfony Docker](https://github.com/dunglas/symfony-docker).
Make sure you do not run XAMPP Services, to free up port 80/443 (the web server) and 3306 (database server), such that they can be run by Docker

1. If not already done, install either:
   - [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (recommended)
   - or: [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (v2.10+)
2. Run `docker compose build --pull --no-cache` to build fresh images
3. Run `docker compose up` (the logs will be displayed in the current shell) <br />
   Run `docker compose up -d` (so with -d) to detach from the compose process. <br />
   You can view the logs in Docker Desktop by opening "Containers" -> "php-1" -> "Actions" -> "View Details" <br />
   - For dev, to disable HTTPS:<br/>
     Add environmental variable SERVER_NAME with value :80, e.g. like this: Run `SERVER_NAME=:80 docker compose up -d`
4. Wait for the logs to show "NOTICE: ready to handle connection"
5. Open `http://localhost/ServerManager` in your favorite web browser to open up the Server manager
6. Run `docker compose down --remove-orphans` to stop the Docker containers.
